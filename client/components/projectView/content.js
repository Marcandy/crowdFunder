        <p>Inventist is a world leader in bringing to market groundbreaking and affordable personal e-vehicles. We brought you the Solowheel and the incredibly popular Hovertrax â€“ the original invention launched in May 2013 that started the craze for hoverboards.

        When we introduced our first Solowheel, we billed it as the smallest, greenest, most convenient e-vehicle ever invented. That title now goes to the Iota, which will have 8" wheels and weigh as little as 8lbs. We have a working prototype and are now in the final stages of testing and fine-tuning. As people already know from riding the Solowheel and Hovertrax, our self-balancing technology is the best in the industry, we only use high-quality battery packs and motors, and we use a full suite of electronic safety features. You can expect the same level of quality from the Iota.
