Draw with your finger, mouse, stylus or Apple Pencil and follow it in real time as it copies your movements. Save and share your drawing to start communicating with other Line-us machines!
It's not a plotter nor a printer, it's a draw-er, which gives Line-us its own style and unique character. The magic bit is that Line-us draws in exactly the same order you did.
Just connect it to a USB battery or power supply and you are ready to go. Line-us comes with a small metal plate to hold it in place. You can use it on any writable surface: in your sketchbook, diary, notebook or just a piece of paper. You can also hang it to the wall or mount it on a fridge

','We have been working hard for the last eight months developing Line-us and we’ve had a lot of fun playing with it. We feel like Line-us is a living prototype, which is why we need to develop it further. Having many years of experience in industrial design, tech products and software development we know that feedback is crucial for any product to be truly amazing and fully functioning. This is also the case for Line-us. We have done a lot of work already but want an inspiring community of illustrators, doodlers, hackers and makers to make Line-us even better.

We wear a belt everyday. However, we sacrifice comfort in many situations by wearing a belt, especially while sitting which is a major pattern in our life today.
The X-Flex Belt is reinvented to solve this problem. It helps us to dress up in a formal way, and also provides extra comfort while seated due to the stretchable woven fabric structure in the back. The X-Flex belt is a revolutionized product serving the best of both worlds for people looking for comfort without sacrificing looks.
